A Confession platform:
- Users could register accounts to join the platform.
- Users could search for their old schools/ classes and post their confessions.
- Users could opt to reveal or hide their own identities.
- Users could comment/ like on one another’s confessions.
- Confessions which are most liked will make featured positions on the dashboard.
- Note: Within the budget, users could NOT add friend or follow, or send messages to each other. They could only comment on or like confessions.
B. A Dare & Challenge Board:
- Users could post Dare or Challenge contests where they must place a certain amount of money in the contests.
- Other users will accept the Dare & Challenge in the condition they must place their own money in the contests too.
- Within a specific timeline, users who joined in the contests must finish them and submit the proper results.
- The party who wins will take all the money placed in.
- System administrator has the ability to watch the whole process and decide the winning party if conflicts or claims occur.
C. A User Ranking System:
- Users are awarding points based on their activities (post a confession, create or take a dare & challenge) and get more popular over time.
- Admin could define certain badges based on earning points to rank users (for example: newbie, learner,… to more advanced titles). Tokens (Yolo Coins)can also be used on the site for the Dares and challenges but they must have been bought with real money. Just like on www.kuluya.com or in the Android game Temple Run or Despicable Me Minion Rush.
- Featured users of the week/ month will make the list on homepage.
D. Localization & Recommendation System:
- Automatically detect user’s location and direct to appropriate places.
- Recommend schools within specific area.
E. Subscription Plans:
- Admin could define different subscription plans.
- Users could pay to apply for specific plans.




The Dares and Challenge. A user goes to the Dare Section and creates a dare, He or she must have deposited some amount in his or her wallet via voguepay.com. Each Dare has an amount attached to it say $1000 by User A. Then User B clicks to take up the dare, A clock or some indicator is shown to other users that the Dare has been picked and they can User B must also have added $1000 and if he is able to complete Dare he gets $2000 If not User A gets $2000. User A can decide to keep dare open for other users or close it. The stake becomes bigger now if the User A decides to rollover i.e. $2000 from User A and $2000 from User C. if User B did not complete 

The Challenge is different
The User A alone drops the $1000 and User B just trys to do it

Each Dare or Challenge must be moderated by an admin to ensure no one is cheated, so the site is sort of an escrow service. The admin must also be able to set a gauge for various types of Dares and Challenges such that Some Dares/Challenges are more attactive to users for example, it may be possible to say the minimum amount for the Dare for Free users (Standard users)  is $300 while for Basic Users is $200 and Premium Users is $100


The point is to make people have fun and enjoy doing different things probably michevious but guided (the site would have a disclaimer). The name I have registered is www.yolo.ng. it's a short and good name (easy to remember). You only live once so live it well have fun. Confess the crazy things of the past. Let others learn from it and move on. Thats the idea

www.campustalker.com and www.yolo.ng could sort of make each other grow.



There is a need to define subscription packages, for example: Basic member: xx $, Advanced: xxx $. There should be a space in the backend for admin to define all that.



Plus, the users will be able to make friend with each other on the site however still be able to anonymously (to the public or non-firends) post confessions, A post by a user who registered as a member of a schoolgets added to that schools posts.

hey could create Dares and Challenges and comment/ join Dares or Challenges, 
Also, there is a list of  open Dares and Challenges which can be filtered
